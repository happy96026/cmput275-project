Description: Human vs Computer version of the board game RISK. 
             Rules and guidelines followed are those outlined on
             www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/risk.pdf with the
             two player variation implemented.

Accessories: N/A

Wiring instructions: N/A

Operating instructions:
With all included files and folders in the terminal's working directory,
run the game using the command: python3 Project.py
The game board will initialize and you will take turns with the computer
placing two infantry on your green territories and one on a neutral 
yellow territory by clicking with the mouse on the desired territory
until a total of 40 units are on the board per player. 
Then turn taking will commence. 

Each turn, if card trading is possible the program prompts the player
yes or no (y or n). Then the player must select three cards that either
have matching values (ex. 5,5,5) or three different values (ex, 1,5,10) 
as explained in the rule book inlcuded as a link in the description. 
Wild cards can act as any of the values.

After card trading has been finalized, player will then have the option
to attack enemy territories. This is done by clicking the territory to 
generate the attack from followed by the enemy territory to attack. 
Once the territories have been selected the player will be prompted to
enter the number of dice they wish to roll. The program then calculates
the result of the attack and loops back to the beginning of the attack
phase to perform futher attacks.

Once attacking is complete, the user may then move infantry from any 
owned territory to any other owned territory, provided a path exists
over territories owned by that player. This is done by clicking on the
desired territories followed by entering the number of infantry.
At this point player 1's turn is complete.

For player 2's turn, the only interaction required from the human player
is to enter the number of dice to be rolled as the defender for either
their territories or the neutral territories.
Turn taking continues until either all of player 1 (green) or player 2 
(red) territories have been eliminated at which point the game ends.

Notes: 
    - An edge (path) does exist between Alaska and Kamchatka (the
        easternmost territory on Asia)
    - Some actions have no return. For example once you declare you have
        finished attacking there is no way to go back if you ended your
        turn by mistake.
    - Prompts are still shown on screen during Player 2's turn so that 
        Player 1 can follow along and understand what is happening
    - The time that prompts are displayed on screen vary and may go too
        quickly for someone who doesn't know the rules of the game.
